# python-api-challenge
Empirically showing the impact to weather/temperature as distance to the equator decreases by creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Observable trends in the data
1)	There is clear correlation between max teetered and proximity to the equator - the closer one is to gets to the equator the higher tempters they will experience
a.	Northern hemisphere – Temperature v Latitude

b.	Southern hemisphere – Temperature v Latitude

2)	There appears to be moderate correlation between cloudiness and proximity to the equator
a.	Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

3)	Although visially there appears to be a relationship found with windspeed and latitude, it’s not as strong as a relationship as we'd like to see to show corelation, more research is needed to make this determination
